## Free Text Writer

![Text Writer Image](https://github.com/KevinDanikowski/text-rewriter/blob/master/misc/images/interface.png?raw=true)
Rewriters (spinners) are expensive, work "alright" and are complicated. Rewriters have only existed for a short while, while translators have mountains of data, grasp of human language, and a longer history. Using translators with some other apps, we are able to successfully build a rewriter with a wide array of differentiation depending on processing languages.

# How It Works

English Text (start lang) => Processing Languages (=> spanish => polish => etc.) => Rewritten English Text (end lang)

Addons:
- Autocompletion
- Thesaurus
- Translator Choice (default: google)
- (future) Machine learning thesaurus library/suggestions

## App Build
Languages (javascript)
Frontend (React, graphql)
Backend (node, express, mysql, graphql)
Testing (mocha, enzyme, chai)

# Features to be added
